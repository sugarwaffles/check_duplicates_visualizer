# Check Duplicates Visualizer - Streamlit Web App

- A simple interactive visualizer I built using **Streamlit** to understand how the `hasDuplicate()` function works step by step.
- It helps me familiarize basic data structures (like sets) and control flow by simulating how the function executes on a given array.
- Mainly trying to learn the **Streamlit** framework 
- May explore building a mini interpreter in future?
