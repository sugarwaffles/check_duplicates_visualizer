# check_duplicates_visualizer
- A simple interactive visualizer I built using **Streamlit** to understand how the `hasDuplicate()` function works step by step.
- It helps me familiarize basic data structures (like sets) and control flow by simulating how the function executes on a given array.
- Mainly trying to learn the **Streamlit** framework
